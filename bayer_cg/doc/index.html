<div class=title>Assignment 4: Programmable Shading</div>

15 November: Updated to use the full <span class="math">float4</span>
size of the texture coordinates.  This reduces the number of texture
units used from eight to five and eliminates one arithmetic operation
in the fragment program.  Updated table to show increased frames per second.

<span class=heading>OVERVIEW</span>
<p>

For this assignment, I implemented reconstruction ("demosaicking") of
a Bayer pattern image into an RGB image using Cg vertex and fragment
programs.  A stream of incoming Bayer pattern data is reconstructed in
real-time and written into an OpenGL texture.  My sample program
demonstrates a rotatable quad textured with the reconstructed image to
emphasize the flexibility offered by having the reconstructed image
available as a texture in real-time.  My sample program also uses
other vertex and fragment programs to allow color adjustments like
brightness, contrast, and grayscale.

<p>
<br>
<span class=heading>BACKGROUND</span>
<p>

Digital cameras commonly use only a single CCD to capture an image.
Therefore, these cameras capture only a single luminance value for each
image pixel.  To support color imaging with a single CCD, a color
filter array (CFA) typically covers the CCD and only allows particular
wavelengths of light to pass through at each pixel.  The Bayer pattern
[1] is a common CFA pattern.  A Bayer pattern CFA passes through red,
green, or blue light to each pixel in a pattern composed of repeating
2x2 blocks of R-G-G-B:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="bayer_pattern.png" border=0px>
</div>
<p>

To reconstruct an RGB image from Bayer pattern data, the two missing
color values at each pixel are interpolated from the pixel's
neighboring color values.  Bilinear interpolation is fast and simple
compared to other techniques [2] but gives satisfactory results.

<p>

In bilinear interpolation of a Bayer pattern image, the green
component at red and blue Bayer pattern pixels is simply the average
of the north, east, south, and west neighbors, because every red and
blue pixel has four green pixels surrounding it in those directions.

<p>

At a green pixel in a Bayer pattern image, the red and blue components
are the average of the two adjacent red or blue pixels.  The two
adjacent pixels can be horizontally or vertically adjacent.

<p>

At red and blue pixels in a Bayer pattern image, the missing blue or
red component is the average of the four diagonally-neighboring
north-east, north-west, south-east, and south-west pixels.

<p>
Here is a Bayer pattern image:
<p>
<img src="out_bayer.png" border=1px style="margin-right:1em;">
<img src="out_bayer_zoom.png" border=1px>
<p>
Here is the above image after being processed by my
vertex and fragment programs:
<p>
<img src="out_color.png" border=1px style="margin-right:1em;">
<img src="out_color_zoom.png" border=1px>

<p>
<br>
<span class=heading>IMPLEMENTATION</span>
<p>

The impetus for implementing Bayer pattern reconstruction using vertex
and fragment programs stems from a component of a research project
that transfers a stream of images from a color digital video camera
across a network to be displayed.  Bandwidth could be conserved and
latency could decrease if the raw Bayer pattern images were
transferred across the network instead of the RGB image reconstructed
automatically by the camera; the Bayer pattern image is one-third the
size of the RGB image.  If the receiving computer could send the Bayer
pattern image directly to the graphics card for display instead of
performing the interpolation on the CPU, then the CPU would be freed
for other tasks.

<p>

I originally wrote a Bayer pattern renderer using fixed-function
OpenGL.  The renderer first decomposes the Bayer pattern image into
four half-resolution images that each contain one of the red, blue,
and two green color channels.  The renderer accomplishes this through
texture mapping, using nearest-neighbor interpolation with the correct
offsets to isolate each color channel.  These four half-resolution
color channels are then magnified to the full resolution using
bilinear texture interpolation and composited using multitexturing and
blending.  This method runs at around 200 frames per second on my test
system, but it results in somewhat blurry images. There is no
guarantee that the known color intensities from the Bayer pattern
image will remain intact in the computed RGB image; the method is not
pixel-exact.

<p>

The Bayer pattern reconstruction performed by my Cg vertex and
fragment programs is pixel-exact and gives higher quality results than
my previous method.

<p>

My Cg Bayer pattern reconstruction works by loading the vertex and
fragment programs and drawing a quad the size of the Bayer pattern
image using an orthographic projection.  Therefore, each generated
fragment corresponds to a single pixel in the Bayer pattern image.  In
order to properly compute the two missing color components at a pixel,
we must know which color pixel in the Bayer pattern image we are
processing.

<p>

It would probably be slow to load and run a different
fragment program for each of the colors in the Bayer pattern.
Therefore, a single fragment program is run for all the fragments, but
the program is able to efficiently compute which color Bayer pixel it
is processing.  This is accomplished through a texture lookup into a
2x2 RGBA texture defined as:

<pre>
const GLfloat MASK[] =
{
	0.0, <span style="color:red;">1.0</span>, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, <span style="color:red;">1.0</span>, 0.0,
	<span style="color:red;">1.0</span>, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, <span style="color:red;">1.0</span>
}
</pre>

Each of the four texels in this "color mask" represents one of the
color channels in the Bayer pattern.  Note that I consider there to be
two green color channels, each layed out like the red and blue
components in the Bayer pattern.  Although this texture is only 2x2, I
set the texture wrap in both directions to repeat.  The repeat texture
coordinate wrap allows this 2x2 texture to function as if it were the
full size of the Bayer pattern image, with this 2x2 pattern repeated
throughout the texture.

<p>

In order to compute the averages for bilinear interpolation, the
fragment program must lookup all the surrounding pixels' values.  The
fragment program could compute the texture coordinates of these pixels
itself, but instead I compute them in the vertex program.  For this
application, computing the texture coordinates in the vertex program
results in the correct interpolated texture coordinates being passed
to the fragment program.  Additionally, this saves a few instructions
in the fragment program.  Because the fragment programs typically run
many more times than vertex programs, this simplification of the
fragment program increases performance.

<p>

The code for the vertex program is:

<pre>
void
bayerv (float2 position : POSITION,
	float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0,

	out float4 oPosition       : POSITION,
	out float2 oTexCoord       : TEXCOORD0,
	out float4 oTexCoord_ne_nw : TEXCOORD1,
	out float4 oTexCoord_n_s   : TEXCOORD2,
	out float4 oTexCoord_e_w   : TEXCOORD3,
	out float4 oTexCoord_se_sw : TEXCOORD4)
{
	oPosition = float4 (position, 0, 1);
	oTexCoord = texCoord;

	<span style="color:green";>// Calculate texture coordinates of neighboring fragments.</span>
	oTexCoord_ne_nw.xy = texCoord + 1;
	oTexCoord_ne_nw.zw = texCoord + float2 (-1, 1);
	oTexCoord_n_s.xy   = texCoord + float2 (0, 1);
	oTexCoord_n_s.zw   = texCoord - float2 (0, 1);
	oTexCoord_e_w.xy   = texCoord + float2 (1, 0);
	oTexCoord_e_w.zw   = texCoord - float2 (1, 0);
	oTexCoord_se_sw.xy = texCoord - float2 (-1, 1);
	oTexCoord_se_sw.zw = texCoord - 1;
}

</pre>

The vertex program passes through the position and texture coordinate.
It also calculates the texture coordinates of most of the neighboring
pixels.  Because I use rectangular textures, the texture coordinates
are integers.  I can just add or subtract 1 from the texture
coordinates to find the neighboring texture coordinates.  I pack the
center texture coordinate and the eight neighboring texture
coordinates into five texture units.

<pre>

{
	<span style="color:green;">// Fetch Bayer texture color at neighboring fragments.</span>
	float bayer_ne     = texRECT (bayer, texCoord_ne_nw.xy).r;

	<span style="color:green;">// Calculate fragment color.</span>
	color.r =
		color_mask.r * bayer_center +

	color.g =

		color_mask.a * bayer_center +
		color_mask.b * adjacent +
		color_mask.r * adjacent;

	color.b =
		color_mask.b * bayer_center +
		color_mask.r * diagonal +
		color_mask.g * horizontal +
		color_mask.a * vertical;
}

</pre>

<p>

The fragment program first performs texture lookups of the Bayer
pattern image at the neighboring texture coordinates passed in by the
vertex program.  It then calculates all the averages used for the
bilinear interpolation.

<p>

Next, the fragment program assigns <span class=math>color_mask</span> by
performing a texture lookup in the color mask texture.  The texture
coordinates for this lookup are simply half the current fragment's
texture coordinates.  The texture coordinates for the Bayer pattern
rectangle texture have the range <span class=math>([0..w],
[0..h])</span> and the texture coordinates for the color mask have the
range <span class=math>([0..1], [0..1])</span>.  Because the color
mask uses repeating texture coordinates, only the fractional part of
the texture coordinates matter.  Therefore, if the current fragment
has an even <span class=math>s</span> texture coordinate, for example,
<span class=math>0.5 * s</span> has a 0 fractional component.
On the other hand, if the current fragment has an odd <span
class=math>s</span> texture coordinate, then <span class=math>0.5 *
s</span> has 0.5 as its fractional component.  Because the color
mask has only two texels in each dimension and uses nearest-neighbor
interpolation, a texture coordinate of 0.0 hits one texel and a
texture coordinate of 0.5 hits the other texel.

<p>

After the fragment program performs the color mask texture lookup,
<span class=math>color_mask</span> is all zeros except in one
component, the component that represents the color of the current
fragment in the Bayer pattern.  The alpha value represents the second
green channel.

<p>

Finally, the fragment program computes the fragment color.  For each
of the (r,g,b) color components, the fragment program uses the color
mask to include only the arithmetic term necessary for the fragment's
Bayer pattern color.  For example, the red component at a blue Bayer
pattern pixel is the average of the diagonal neighbors' color values.
Because <span class=math>color_mask.b</span> is <span
class=math>1.0</span> and the only component of <span
class=math>color_mask</span> that is non-zero, only the <span
class=math>diagonal</span> term is added to <span
class=math>color.r</span>:

<pre>
<span style="color:red;">// example: at blue Bayer pattern pixel</span>
<span style="color:red;">// red pixels are on diagonals</span>
<span style="color:red;">// green pixels surround horizontally and vertically</span>
color.r =
	color_mask.r * bayer_center + <span style="color:red;">// 0</span>
	color_mask.b * diagonal + <span style="color:red;">    // diagonal</span>
	color_mask.g * vertical + <span style="color:red;">    // 0</span>
	color_mask.a * horizontal; <span style="color:red;">   // 0</span>
color.g =
	color_mask.g * bayer_center + <span style="color:red;">// 0</span>
	color_mask.a * bayer_center + <span style="color:red;">// 0</span>
	color_mask.b * adjacent + <span style="color:red;">    // adjacent</span>
	color_mask.r * adjacent; <span style="color:red;">     // 0</span>
color.b =
	color_mask.b * bayer_center + <span style="color:red;">// bayer_center</span>
	color_mask.r * diagonal + <span style="color:red;">    // 0</span>
	color_mask.g * horizontal + <span style="color:red;">  // 0</span>
	color_mask.a * vertical; <span style="color:red;">     // 0</span>
</pre>

<p>

Note that this computation can be expressed as a matrix
multiplication:

<p>
<pre>
float4x4 m = float4x4 (bayer_center, vertical, diagonal, horizontal,
		       adjacent, bayer_center, adjacent, bayer_center,
		       diagonal, horizontal, bayer_center, vertical,
		       0, 0, 0, 1);
color = mul (m, color_mask);
</pre>

The <span class=math>cgc</span> compiler outputs the same assembly
code with both expressions, but I find the original way to express the
calculation clearer.

<p>

As linked at the top of the page, here are some videos showing my
programs running on a stream of images.  I did not capture the images
myself, but rather I extracted some frames from a video and dropped
two of the color channels at each pixel in each frame to create
simulated Bayer pattern images.  My sample program updates the input
Bayer pattern image at about 30 frames per second, a realistic rate
for capturing from a camera.  Note that these videos do show
compression artifacts.

</ul>

<p>
<br>
<span class=heading>PERFORMANCE</span>
<p>

I measured the frames per second achieved by three Bayer pattern
reconstruction methods: CPU-based function taken from the gPhoto
digital camera library [3], my fixed-function OpenGL method, and my Cg
vertex and fragment shader method:

<p>
Bayer pattern image reconstruction, frames per second:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0px cellpadding=10px rules=all>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>320x240 pixels</th>
<th>640x480 pixels</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<th>OpenGL</th>
<td>780</td>
<td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Cg</th>
<td>122</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

The test system is a Pentium 4 3.0 GHz with an NVIDIA Quadro FX 500
running RedHat Enterprise Linux WS 3.0.  The frames per second for my
OpenGL-based method are terrific, but the image quality is poor
compared to the other methods.  The CPU-based method performs about
twice as fast as my Cg method.  This is disappointing, but but it is
important to recognize that using Cg frees the CPU for other tasks.
Furthermore, the Quadro FX 500 is the slowest Quadro card.  On a
higher-end or newer card I would expect a 3 to 4 times speed increase.

<p>
<br>
<span class=heading>ADDITIONS</span>
<p>

In addition to performing Bayer pattern reconstruction, my sample
program allows adjustment of some properties of the resulting image and
demonstrates how the interpolated image is rendered to a texture.

<p>

This simple vertex program transforms the incoming vertex by the
concatenated modelview-projection matrix and passes through the
texture coordinate to the fragment program:

<pre>
void
imagev (float4 position : POSITION,
	float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0,

	uniform float4x4 ModelViewProj,

	out float4 oPosition : POSITION,
	out float2 oTexCoord : TEXCOORD0)
{
	oPosition = mul (ModelViewProj, position);
	oTexCoord = texCoord;
}
</pre>

<p>
The fragment program takes the brightness, contrast, and a grayscale
option as parameters:

<pre>
void
imagef (float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0,
	
	uniform float brightness,
	uniform float contrast,
	uniform bool grayscale,
	uniform samplerRECT decal,
	
	out float4 color : COLOR)
{
	color = texRECT (decal, texCoord);

	<span style="color:green;">// Adjust brightness.</span>
	color *= brightness;

	<span style="color:green;">// Adjust contrast.</span>
	color = (color - 0.5) * contrast + 0.5;

	<span style="color:green;">// Convert to grayscale.</span>
	color.rgb = grayscale ? dot (float3 (0.3, 0.59, 0.11), color.rgb) : color.rgb;
}
</pre>

The brightness parameter simply modulates the color.  The contrast
parameter centers the color range about 0, modulates the color, then
returns the color range to [0..1].  I think that a correct contrast
adjustment would first have to compute the average luminance of all
the pixels in the image and then scale each pixel's deviation from
the average luminance, but I do not do that.  The grayscale option
finds the luminance using the standard conversion coefficients for
human vision.
